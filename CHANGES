Revision history for MinCED
0.1.6	18-Jul-2014
		Fix off-by-one error in the gff output.
		
0.1.5   03-Apl-2014
		Changed the behaviour of the '-spacers' option. Without any
		output file given the behaviour is the same as before, creating
		a file with the input name's prefix and adding '_spacers.fa' to
		the end. Now when an output file is given the '_spacers.fa' will
		be appended to that name, not the input file's name

            * full gff format
                - on top of what is written in the summary format, adds
                  in individual repeat_unit annotations for the direct repeats
            * output all spacers found in fasta format
