MinCED - Mining CRISPRs in Environmental Datasets


MinCED is a program to find Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic
Repeats (CRISPRs) in full genomes or environmental datasets such as metagenomes,
in which sequence size can be anywhere from 100 to 800 bp. MinCED runs from the
command-line and was derived from CRT (http://www.room220.com/crt/):
  Charles Bland et al., CRISPR Recognition Tool (CRT): a tool for automatic
  detection of clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats, BMC
  Bioinformatics 8, no. 1 (2007): 209.


INSTALLATION

You need to install these dependencies first:
  * Java (http://www.java.com/en/download/)

In the MinCED folder, compile the source files: 
  * javac  *.java

To run MinCED, in the same folder:
  * java minced [options] inputFile [outputFile]

The help page can be obtained by typing:
  * java minced --help

You can get the MinCED version this way:
  * java minced --version


EXAMPLES

Finding CRISPRs in the E. coli genome:
    java minced ecoli.fna

To find repeats in short sequences, we need to decrease the minimum number of
repeats to find. For example, in 100 bp reads, we could not possibly find more
than 2 repeats:
    java minced -minNR 2 metagenome.fna

The output can be large, so save it in a file:
    java minced -minNR 2 metagenome.fna metagenome.crisprs
